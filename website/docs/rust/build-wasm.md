# Build WASM

## Build for Browsers

### wasm-pack

Building rust program to WebAssembly for browsers uses [wasm-pack](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack).  
Run `cargo install wasm-pack` or installer is available at [github releases](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack/releases) or [here](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/).

Run this command to build WebAssembly.  
More command line options can be found at [wasm-pack build](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-pack/commands/build.html).

```bash title="build for browsers"
wasm-pack build --release --out-name prime --target web
```

This command generate `prime.js` , `prime_bg.wasm` in `./pkg` directory.

:::info
Generated `prime_bg.wasm` can be run as standalone wasm.

### wasm32-unknown-emscripten

When building wasm with [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) targeting `wasm32-unknown-emscripten`.  
`wasm32-unknown-emscripten` target have to be installed.

This command shows all of the targets supported by rust.  
Check that `wasm32-unknown-emscripten` is installed.

```bash title="list all targets"
rustup target list
```

```bash title="targets list ouput"
// omit...
wasm32-unknown-emscripten (installed)
// omit...
```

Or, you can install target with

```bash title="add target"
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-emscripten
```

Additionally, [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) have to be installed.  
Then add link option in `.cargo/config.toml` (see [Configuration - The Cargo Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html)).

This command build and generate `prime.wasm`.

```bash title="build with targeting wasm32-unknown-emscripten"
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-emscripten
```

## Build for Standalone

`prime_bg.wasm` which is generated by wasm-pack can be used as standalone wasm.   
Here show the ways to build WebAssembly using `cargo build`.

Before building standalone wasm, we need to check the build targets installed.  
This command shows all of the targets supported by rust.

```bash title="list all targets"
rustup target list
```

```bash title="targets list ouput"
// omit...
wasm32-unknown-unknown (installed)
wasm32-wasi (installed)
// omit...
```

These targets are briefly expalined [here](https://docs.wasmtime.dev/wasm-rust.html).  
You can install target using `rustup` command.

```bash title="add target"
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknowns
```

Now, let's build standalone wasm. 

First, we need to comment out or remove the `wasm_bindgen` attribute and unused import because wasm_bindgen adds or removes symbols for combining JavaScript.  
More document on `wasm_bindgen` can be found at [The wasm-bindgen Guide](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/), [wasm-bindgen - crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/wasm-bindgen/).


```rust title="comment out or remove these 2 lines"
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
```

###  wasm32-unknown-unknown

This command build standalone wasm for WASI and generates `prime_standalone.wasm`  
Then we can use .wasm standalone.

```bash title="build with targeting wasm3-unknown-unknown"
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### wasm32-wasi

When targeting `wasm32-wasi`, it may requires [wasi crate](https://crates.io/crates/wasi) and may requires fixing source code.

```bash title="build with targeting wasm3-wasi (sample program does not works on wasmer)"
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasi
```

This command generates `prime_standalone.wasm`.
